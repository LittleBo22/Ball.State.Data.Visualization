# Ball.State.Data.Visualization
place to practice for data visualization class

Hi! My name is Kathryn. I am new to coding and am setting this up as part of my class requirement.
I am interested in SQL, Python, and R.
I am excited to learn these languages and becoming more involved with the computer & data science
communities.

Thanks!
